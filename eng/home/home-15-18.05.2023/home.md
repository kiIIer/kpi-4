Text B is organized into numbered parts, each serving a specific purpose. For example, Part 1 presents the research rationale. The structure of an abstract, which will be discussed further in Activity 6, can be seen in this text.
Text C comprises three paragraphs. The first two paragraphs are directed towards potential reviewers and offer recommendations. The third paragraph discusses one of the criteria used to evaluate articles.
Text D consists of several paragraphs that progressively provide information about the journal, starting with general details and gradually becoming more specific. The final two paragraphs focus on the specific areas of research that Computer Monthly emphasizes, as indicated by the headings.

### Ex 5

1. In Text A, the pronoun "it" in the second sentence refers to the journal mentioned, which is the Oxford Review of Education. In Text C, there is an occurrence of the pronoun "it" in the second sentence under the heading "Originality," where it refers to the word "article." Additionally, the pronoun "you" is used multiple times, addressing a potential reviewer. This use of pronouns reflects a relatively direct and informal style of writing.
