## Assignment

Textbook: Infotech
U.25 'Java',  Ex.1(A,B)/125,  2(A-C)/126-127,  3(A,B)/127-128. Text:  'Java' ( put 3 questions)  + Quiz.

## Solution

### Ex 1A

1. b
2. c
3. e
4. a
5. d

### Ex 1B

1. c
2. e
3. a
4. b
5. d

### Ex 2A

1. java was created by sun microsystems
2. With the compiler
3. It is compatible
4. There is parallel computing
5. C#, C# is better. Plz use C#. And there is also Adobe flash
6. flash movies, not animations

### Ex 2B

1. a
2. d
3. f
4. b
5. c
6. e

### Ex 2C

1. animated(no...) Currently it's HTML5, CSS and Javascripts work to do it
2. object oriented(NOOOOOOOOO) The word similar triggers me so much(. The only simmilarity is syntax. The java has garbage collector and due to it, java is easier and much slower, c++ is a system programming language, without gc and with direct memory management.
3. compiled; interpreted
4. used Languages built over Java like Kotlin. And also, Objective C and Swift are only options for iOS
5. configured(NO)
6. pronounced No, It's not just for web, and it's not simplified... I should not care about it, but I just can't.

### Ex 3A

| /t/       | /d/        | /id/            |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| stopped   | described  | decided         |
| asked     | called     | executed        |
| produced  | programmed | object-oriented |
| watched   | configured | persuaded       |
| published | arragned   | converted       |
|           | designed   |                 |

### Ex 3B

1. decided
2. developed
3. called
4. had
5. based
6. renamed
7. could
8. were
9. began
10. supported

### Text

I can argue with this text for over an hour but i will just say 1 thing. C#. Like... C#? Never heard of it? It got .NET runtime, which allows it to be ran anywhere. The garbage collector algorithm is better in C#. The memory management is better in C#. Runtime can be built with the app in one single executable and then ran in cloud environment. I've spent my whole life near C# programmer and I know about it quite a lot. Also it's better for enterprise development. More features, more powerful language itself without any frameworks. But to be honest, rewrite it in Rust. I included a cute poster^^'
