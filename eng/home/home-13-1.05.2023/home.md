1. How does farming your garden can make children become accustomed to violence? Not all games are the same. How does chess teach violence? Or Sims? It's true that some games can have... Interesting content, but it's not the games which make kids violent.
2. Yep, my gf plays wow and it's super fun
3. Doesn't anything can have negative effects? Like... Food? Child can love food and rather eat then homework? Why blame games? It's true that you can play them, but you can read instead and it will distract you from school?
4. Yep. Real-time strategy games demand lightning-fast decision making, overall stragegy and control of battle. Love this genre. Just check this [vid](https://youtu.be/bexWuHmV32A?t=566). Player just casually controls army on frontline, orders 3 subdivisions to split and attack, while making reinforcements at home, optimizing economy and then army again at the same time!

### Task

1. Real-time strategy (RTS) is a video game genre that involves players controlling units and managing resources in real-time to achieve objectives such as building a base, gathering resources, and defeating enemies. Starcraft 2 is one of the most popular games in this genre.
2. One of the reasons people enjoy RTS games like Starcraft 2 is the strategic thinking and decision-making involved. Players need to make quick decisions based on limited information while also managing resources efficiently. The game also requires multitasking and fast reflexes, making it a challenging and engaging experience.
3. Examples of other popular RTS games include Age of Empires, Warcraft III, Command and Conquer, and Company of Heroes. Each game has its own unique features and gameplay mechanics, but they all share the common theme of players controlling units and managing resources in real-time.
