## Solutioin

### Ex 2A

1. c
2. a
3. d
4. e
5. b

### Ex 2B

I checked em

### Ex 2C

1. Understand the problem and plan a solution
2. Make a flowchart of the program
3. Write instructions in a programming language
4. Compile the program(to turn it into machine code) (First if all, Java, C# use jit compilations and you compile them in byte code, not in machine code, the byte code is then read by either java virtual machine or .NET Runtime. Secondly, Python and Ruby are interpreted and do not require compiling, the interpreter reads them line by line, javascript as well, and typescript is compiled to javascript)
5. Test and debug the program(Yep, this one is important)
6. Prepare documentation

### Ex 3A

I would only consider C++ and Java high-level languages. Others are considered low level or legacy languages now(like machine code or assembly used to back in the days). But only considering the text there are 8:

1. Fortran
2. Cobold
3. Bacis
4. Visual basic
5. Pascal
6. C
7. C++
8. Java

### Ex 3B

1. Yep, they do understand our langualge. ChatGPT for example. An AI trained model which provides human like responces and can write code based on them, but for the sake of exercise no, cuz they operate with machine code
2. Basically instead of writing 001011 to make processor move data to register, you can write mov. It makes things a bit easier for programmers to write but at this level there is almost nothing to write.
3. To make programs... Like... Normal programs which can then be compiled into machine code for different machines.
4. Pascal, but... no... plz don't learn that...
5. Oh, i mentioned this one b4, compiler translates language into machine code and interpretor reads line by line executing them
6. They markup text

### Ex 3C

1. XML
2. Fortran
3. Java
4. VoiceXML
5. Cobol

### Ex 4

1. programming
2. program
3. programmers
4. programmable
5. compilation
6. compiler
7. compile
8. bug
9. debugger; debug
10. debugging

### Ex 5A

1. done
2. It's expensive to set up a data-processing area
3. It's advisable to test the programs under different conditions
4. It's unusual to write a program that works correctly on the first time it is used
5. It's important to use a good debugger to fix errors
6. It's easy to learn VisualBasic(but why would you do that?)

### Ex 5B

1. c
2. b
3. b
4. c
5. c
6. a
7. a
8. b

### Text

Rust is a systems programming language that is designed to be fast, reliable, and safe. Its syntax is similar to that of C++, making it easy for programmers who already know that language to pick up Rust quickly.

One of the unique features of Rust is its ownership system, which ensures memory safety and prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and use-after-free errors. This makes it a popular choice for developing applications that require high performance and security, such as web browsers and game engines.

Moreover, Rust is an open-source language with an active and supportive community. It offers excellent documentation and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easier for developers to write and maintain code.

Additionally, Rust is gaining popularity in the industry, and many companies, including Dropbox, Mozilla, and Microsoft, are using Rust for their projects. It is overtaking the world of no GC-lanbuages. The Microsoft Azure CTO Tweeted [Speaking of languages, it's time to halt starting any new projects in C/C++ and use Rust for those scenarios where a non-GC language is required. For the sake of security and reliability. the industry should declare those languages as deprecated.](https://twitter.com/markrussinovich/status/1571995117233504257?lang=en). Learning Rust can, therefore, be a valuable asset for your future career as a software developer.

Overall, Rust is a powerful and innovative language that offers a unique set of features for developers. Its focus on safety and performance makes it an attractive choice for many applications, and its popularity and growing community make it a worthwhile investment for anyone interested in programming.
